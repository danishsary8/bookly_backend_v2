## 2026-10-31 · Task F: phone sign-in code hint

**Why:** the API only sends a phone sign-in code to a number that is confirmed and linked to the Bookly Telegram bot
(backend `PhoneCodeController::reachable`: `phone_e164` + `phone_verified_at` + `telegram_chat_id`). A number typed in
Account → Profile is only a courier contact and is not confirmed, so people (the owner too) got no code.

**Branches**
- Frontend `fix/phone-code-hint`: https://github.com/danishsary8/bookly_frontend/pull/new/fix/phone-code-hint
  (commits `ccc4e65` "Explain how to get a phone sign-in code", `d78dc9d` "Log the phone sign-in code hint").
- Backend: no change.

**Status:** done (pushed, not merged).

**What changed**
- `src/features/auth/PhoneCodeSignIn.tsx`: hint under the phone field (`TextField` `hint`, so it is the field's
  accessible description). After the first "Send code", the number is re-checked on every key press, so a fixed number
  clears the error and brings the hint back without pressing Send again.
- `src/pages/account/ProfilePage.tsx`: hint under the phone field with a link to `/account/security`.
- `src/i18n/en.ts`, `src/i18n/km.ts`: `signin.phoneCodeHint`, `account.phoneHint`, `account.phoneHintLink`, `account.phoneHintEnd`.
  - EN login: "Codes only go to a confirmed number. Not confirmed yet? Use Continue with Telegram below, or confirm it in
    Account → Sign-in & security → Phone → Confirm."
  - KM login: "លេខកូដផ្ញើទៅតែលេខដែលបានបញ្ជាក់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ។ មិនទាន់បញ្ជាក់? សូមប្រើ «បន្តជាមួយ Telegram» ខាងក្រោម ឬបញ្ជាក់វានៅ គណនី → ការចូល និងសុវត្ថិភាព → លេខទូរស័ព្ទ → បញ្ជាក់។"
  - EN Profile: "Couriers call this number. To sign in with it, it must be confirmed in Sign-in & security."
  - KM Profile: "អ្នកដឹកជញ្ជូនទូរស័ព្ទមកលេខនេះ។ ដើម្បីចូលគណនីដោយលេខនេះ វាត្រូវតែបានបញ្ជាក់នៅក្នុង ការចូល និងសុវត្ថិភាព។"
- Tests: 4 new (`src/pages/auth/phone-code-sign-in.test.tsx`: hint EN, hint KM, error clears once the number is fixed
  with no request sent; `src/pages/account/account-pages.test.tsx`: Profile hint + link).

**Tests run**
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors · `npm run typecheck`: clean · `npm test`: 440 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed · `npm run build`: ok.
- Browser (Playwright/Chromium, Vite :5173 + local API :8000, demo customer), EN and KM at 1280 px and 390 px, all pass:
  hint under the field; `123` → Send → error replaces the hint; typing `012 345 678` → error gone, hint back, no
  request sent; Profile hint shows and its link opens Sign-in & security; no page or hint overflow; no console errors.

**Not verified**
- The local API has no Telegram bot, which hides phone sign-in, so `/auth/options` was stubbed to `telegram: true` in the
  browser for the check. Not checked on the live site yet (owner step in `OWNER_TODO.md` section 0).
- A real code from the live bot (not part of this change).
- The Khmer wording has not been checked by a native speaker.

**Decisions the owner made**
- Wording A1 (hint under the field, always visible) + B1 (Profile hint with a link, always shown).
- B for the error: re-check the number on every key press after the first Send.
- No extra review file; this file starts with "How to review".

**Open questions:** none.

**Follow-ups found (not changed in this branch)**
- Profile, Khmer, 390 px: the account tab row is cut at the right edge ("អាសយដ្ឋា…"). It scrolls sideways, and it
  existed before this change.

**Review** (2026-10-31, project review; verdict: **pass, OK to merge**)
- Checklist: branch name and both commit messages are plain, no tool names, no Co-authored-by lines. Only the 7
  files the task needs changed (5 source/i18n, 2 tests) + `docs/WORKLOG.md`. No backend, no migrations, no secrets.
- Re-ran on the pushed branch (`d78dc9d`, clean install): `npm run lint` 0 errors, `npm run typecheck` clean,
  `npm test` 440 passed / 3 skipped, `npm run build` ok. Matches the report above.
- Code: reuses `TextField`'s `hint` prop, so the hint is the field's accessible description and the error replaces it
  like every other field. Re-check after the first Send is small and correct (`phoneChecked` + `checkPhone`); the test
  proves no request is sent while typing. Profile link copies the email hint's pattern. Comment updated.
- Nit (no change needed now): the new Khmer login hint writes "លេខទូរស័ព្ទ" while the field label above it writes
  "លេខទូរសព្ទ". The app already mixes both spellings; leave it for the native-speaker review (owner step) and fix all
  of them together then.
- Nit: the work log went into a second commit; fine, no need to squash.
- Not verifiable here: the live check (owner step, section 0) and a real bot code.


**Where I stopped / next step**
- Task F is finished and pushed. Next: the owner merges `fix/phone-code-hint`, does the live check in `OWNER_TODO.md`
  section 0, then confirms the phone in Sign-in & security (section 4c). Next task prompt: `docs/prompts/02-you-may-also-like.md`.

## 2026-10-31 · Task A: "You may also like" (similar books), PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md 4.1
**Branches**
- Backend `feature/better-similar-books` (pushed): https://github.com/danishsary8/bookly_backend_v2/pull/new/feature/better-similar-books
- Frontend `feature/better-similar-books` (not created yet): https://github.com/danishsary8/bookly_frontend/pull/new/feature/better-similar-books
**Status:** partly done. Backend fixes 1, 3, 4 + the owner's order-status rule are pushed and green; backend
WORKLOG entry and the frontend fix 2 are still to do. (Progress details at the end of this section.)

**What already exists (do not rebuild)**
- Routes (`routes/api.php`): `GET /books/{id}/related` and `GET /books/{id}/also-bought` (same method,
  `BookController::alsoBought` calls `related`), `GET /catalog/recommendations?cart_ids=&exclude_ids=&limit=`
  (note: the path is `/catalog/...`, not `/books/recommendations`). `limit` 1 to 12, default 6.
- Logic: `app/Services/Catalog/RecommendationService.php`.
  - Book page (`getRecommendedIdsForBook`, cached 1 h, key `books:{id}:recommendations:{limit}`):
    1. co-purchases in >= 2 shared paid orders (not pending/cancelled, not soft-deleted), most shared first;
    2. same category AND same author (no ORDER BY, so the database picks the order);
    3. same categories, by units sold, then rating, then newest id;
    4. same authors, by rating, then newest id;
    nothing after that. Always: not the book itself, no duplicates, visible + buyable (`baseBuyableQuery`: an
    active variant with stock > 0, or an ebook/audiobook).
  - Cart (`getRecommendedIdsForCart`, not cached): same categories by units sold, then same authors (newest),
    then store best sellers (`queryPopularBookIds`). Empty cart = store best sellers.
  - Controller `related()` re-loads with `catalogQuery()` (visible only) but does NOT re-check stock.
- Tests: `tests/Feature/Catalog/RelatedBooksTest.php` (5), `tests/Feature/Platform/AlsoBoughtTest.php` (3).
- Frontend: `src/pages/catalog/BookDetailPage.tsx` rows in order: series (`otherInSeries`, from `/series/{id}`),
  "More by {author}" (`otherByAuthor`, up to 8), also-bought (`alsoBought`, ~line 553, eyebrow
  `book.alsoBoughtEyebrow` "Customers also bought", title `book.alsoBought` "Readers also enjoyed", no `loading`
  prop), recently viewed. `src/pages/cart/CartPage.tsx` `CartRecommendations` (`cartPage.recommendedEyebrow`,
  `recommendedWithOrder` / `popularPicks`). Shared row: `src/components/catalog/BookShelf.tsx` (hides itself when
  loaded and empty; skeleton when `loading`). API calls: `src/api/endpoints/catalog.ts`. No frontend test covers
  these rows.

**Audit results on the local demo data (20 books, 10 paid orders)**
- No book pair was bought together twice, so step 1 (co-purchases) never fires: every result is a topic match,
  yet the row says "Customers also bought".
- Book 5 *The Sign of the Four* (Sherlock Holmes #2) → 4, 6, 1, 2, 3, 16. Holmes books appear only because they
  share the author, and they appear in three rows (series, author, also-bought).
- Book 18 *Meditations* → only 1 book (19). No fallback on the book page.
- Cart with book 4 (Holmes #1) → 6, 1, 2, 3, 16, 15. The next book in the series (5) is missing.
- Cache is never cleared; a sold-out book can show for up to 1 h; edits to categories/authors take up to 1 h.
- Khmer strings exist but are marked `// draft`. 390 px browser check not done yet (shared `BookShelf`, 2 cards wide).

**Decisions the owner made (2026-10-31): 1A 2A 3A 4B, with changes**
1. **1A Series first** (book page AND cart): later books in the series first (by `series_order`), then earlier ones;
   step 2 (same category + author) gets a real sort (by sales).
2. **2A Frontend**: remove books already shown in the series or author rows; ask for `limit=12` so enough stay;
   rename the row to eyebrow "More like this", title "You may also like" (+ Khmer); add the loading skeleton;
   **hide the row if fewer than 2 books are left** after removing repeats. Must still work against today's API.
3. **3A changed by the owner**: fill the rest of the book-page row with best sellers from the SAME CATEGORY first,
   then store best sellers. Never the book itself, no duplicates, in stock only.
4. **4B Cache**: cache 12 ids; clear a book's cached list when staff edit the book (version number in the cache
   key, works with the `file` store). **Stock re-check on every read**, so a sold-out book never shows, even when cached.

**Planned steps (one per "confirm")**
- Backend `feature/better-similar-books` from fresh `origin/main`:
  - Step 2: fix 1 (series next-first, then earlier; cart too). Tests: series next-first then earlier; never the book
    itself; no duplicates.
  - Step 3: fix 3 (fallback same-category best sellers, then store best sellers). Test: fallback order.
  - Step 4: fix 4 (cache 12 ids, re-check stock on read, version key bumped on staff book edit). Tests: sold-out
    excluded even when cached; staff edit clears the cache.
  - Then `php artisan test` + `vendor/bin/pint --test`; update `docs/API.md` + `public/openapi.yaml` descriptions
    of the order/behaviour; WORKLOG entry; push.
- Frontend `feature/better-similar-books` from fresh `origin/main`: step 5: fix 2. Then lint, typecheck, test,
  build; browser check: a book in a series (e.g. id 5), a book without one (e.g. id 18 or 1), the cart; desktop +
  390 px; English + Khmer. WORKLOG entry; push.
- Finally: update this section and `docs/OWNER_TODO.md` (merge links, live check).

**Later decisions the owner made (during steps 2 to 4)**
- Series-first matters most in the CART; keep the book page part simple. Cart: never a cart book; with 2 series,
  the next book of each first; out-of-stock rule still applies.
- 3A order fixed as: series > bought together > category+author > same categories > same authors > same-category
  best sellers > store best sellers, filled up to `limit` (frontend will ask 12). Note: "same categories" is
  already sorted by units sold, so it IS the same-category best-seller step; no duplicate step was added.
- 4B changed: ONE catalogue-wide version number in the cache key (not per book), bumped when staff create, edit,
  delete or restore a book or change its authors/categories/series, so other books' lists update too.
- Sales rule = option B: rankings ("best sellers", "bought together") leave out pending, cancelled, **returned**
  and deleted orders; processing and shipped (cash on delivery, not paid yet) still count.
- The "within 1 hour" limits below are accepted; no fix now.

**Backend progress (branch `feature/better-similar-books`)**
| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `eb682dd` | Series first: book page step 0 (next books, then earlier, then unnumbered); cart: per series after the furthest cart book, series take turns; category+author step sorted by units sold. Tests: `tests/Feature/Catalog/SeriesRecommendationsTest.php` |
| `ff52d01` | Store best sellers fill the book-page list up to `limit`. Pushed with one old test failing (my mistake: commit ran in the same command as the tests). |
| `8a62bd0` | Fixes that test: `AlsoBoughtTest` now checks the exact order (B bought together first, D with only cancelled/pending co-orders last as a filler). |
| `73d891a` | Cache: 12 ids per book under `catalog:recommendations-version`; `RecommendationService::catalogChanged()` bumps it after commit (Book `created/updated/deleted/restored` events + explicit calls after author/category sync in staff `BookController::update`, `BookBulkController`, `BookCsvImport::apply`); stock + visibility re-checked on every read, then cut to `limit`. One `unitsSoldSubquery()` helper for all rankings. Tests: `tests/Feature/Catalog/RecommendationCacheTest.php` |
| `9e5b041` | `docs/API.md` (+ new row for `/catalog/recommendations`) and `public/openapi.yaml`: final order, caching, stock rule |
| `f6e26e9` | Returned orders left out of rankings (`notSales()`); test + docs line updated |
- Checks on `f6e26e9`: `php artisan test` 642 passed, `vendor/bin/pint --test` clean. Each new rule test was run
  against the old code first and failed there (proves it tests something).
- Demo data (local API): *Sign of the Four* → 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 16; *Meditations* `limit=12` → 12 books (was 1);
  cart with Holmes #1 → 5, 6, … (next book first).

**Known limits (accepted by the owner, no fix now)**
These do not bump the catalogue version, so the change reaches cached lists within 1 hour instead of at once.
None of them can show a wrong book (stock and visibility are re-checked on every read); a book only joins late.
- A book comes back into stock, or a new format (variant) is added or re-activated.
- A scheduled book goes live at its publish time (no save happens then).
- A category or author is deleted (pivot rows go without a book event).
- After a re-check removes sold-out or hidden books, a cached list can be shorter than `limit` until it is rebuilt.

**Not verified yet:** the frontend part (fix 2) and its browser check. Live API (Render) not called.
**Open questions:** none.
**Where I stopped / next step**
- Backend code, tests and docs are pushed (`f6e26e9`). Next: step 5, backend `docs/WORKLOG.md` entry on
  `feature/better-similar-books` (checks first, push). Then the frontend branch, fix 2.
